  "readme": "# ember-cli-babel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/babel/ember-cli-babel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/babel/ember-cli-babel)\n\nThis Ember-CLI plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to allow you to use ES6 syntax with your\nEmber-CLI project.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev ember-cli-babel\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis plugin should work without any configuration after installing. By default it will take every `.js` file\nin your project and run it through the Babel transpiler to convert the ES6 code to ES5. Running existing ES5 code\nthrough the transpiler shouldn't change the code at all (likely just a format change if it does).\n\nIf you need to customize the way that Babel transforms your code, you can do it by passing in any of the options\nfound [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/). Example:\n\n```js\n// Brocfile.js\n\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  babel: {\n    // disable comments\n    comments: false\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Polyfill\n\nBabel comes with a polyfill that includes a custom [regenerator runtime](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/blob/master/runtime.js)\nand [core.js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js). Many transformations will work without it, but for full support you\nmust include the polyfill in your app. The [Babel feature tour](https://babeljs.io/docs/tour/) includes a note for\nfeatures that require the polyfill to work.\n\nTo include it in your app, pass `includePolyfill: true` in your `babel` options.\n\n### About Modules\n\nEmber-CLI uses its own ES6 module transpiler for the custom Ember resolver that it uses. Because of that,\nthis plugin disables Babel module compilation by blacklisting that transform. If you find that you want to use\nthe Babel module transform instead of the Ember-CLI one, you'll have to explicitly set `compileModules` to `true`\nin your configuration. If `compileModules` is anything other than `true`, this plugin will leave the module\nsyntax compilation up to Ember-CLI.\n",
