To use this just install and then in your component, mixin the `shared-stylist` mixin like so:\n\n```javascript\nimport SharedStylist from 'ember-cli-stylist/mixins/shared-stylist';\nexport default Ember.Component.extend(SharedStylist,{\n  attributeBindings: ['stylist:style'],\n  // your code here\n}\n```\n\nor as it getting to be more common ...\n\n```javascript\nimport SharedStylist from 'ember-cli-stylist/mixins/shared-stylist';\nexport default Ember.Component.extend(SharedStylist,{\n  tagName: '',\n}\n```\n\n```handlebars\n<div style={{stylist}}>\n  Hello world\n</div>\n```\n\nYou can optionally include a property in your component `styleBindings` which will specify which styles you want  proxied. If you don't specify then the default properties proxied are:\n\n> height width minHeight maxHeight minWidth maxWidth fontSize fontFamily fontWeight cursor display\n\nWith the Mixin added your component will now proxy style properties in a safe manner (aka, they will be escaped so XSS attacks are made much harder). For your component called `my-component` a container might use it like so:\n\n    {{my-component width='50%' height='100px' fontWeight=800}}\n\nwhich would result in the style property being set to:\n\n    <div id=\"ember456\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 100px; font-weight: 800px\">\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone.\n\n## Version Compatibility\n\nThis may very well work with older version of Ember and Ember-CLI but it was intended for:\n\n- Ember 1.13.7+\n- Ember-CLI 1.13.7+\n\nYou can see the CI results at: [Travis Reporting](https://travis-ci.org/lifegadget/ember-cli-stylist)\n\n## Repo Contribution\n\nWe're open to your creative suggestions but please move past the \"idea\" stage\nand send us a PR so we can incorporate your ideas without killing ourselves. :)\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis component is free to use under the MIT license:\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 LifeGadget Ltd\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
